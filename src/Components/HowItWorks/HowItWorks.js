			<h3>Historical Context and Research</h3>
			<p>
				Explain how we consulted with specific respected historians or
				institutions to bring these historical figures thinking back to life.
			</p>
			<h3>Science and Methodology</h3>
			<p>
				We loosely explain our algorithm and process here and how it's intuitive
				rather then random and how we use our unique approach and logic to bring
				historical figures back to offer advice
			</p>
			<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
			<p>
				Different credible historians and foundations that offer insight go here
			</p>
			<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
			<p>
				Full disclaimer here that this is just for fun and no decisions are
				meant to be made based off results and we are not liable for any answers
